How MySQL Uses Indexes :

1.Indexes are used to find rows with specific column values quickly
2. Most MySQL indexes (PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, INDEX, and FULLTEXT) are stored in B-trees. 
3. Exceptions are that indexes on spatial data types use R-trees, and that MEMORY tables also support hash indexes.


Storage Engine : InnoDB

InnoDB offers a lot more features than MyISAM that increases performance.
Uses row-Level Locking which has better performance than table-level locking
InnoDB allows parallel INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE queries to be ran on the same table, unlike MyISAM where each query has to wait its turn to run.
InnoDB supports foreign key functionality which is a huge advantage


A storage engine is what MySQL uses to store, handle and retrieve data from a database table.
