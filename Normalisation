Purpose of Normalisation :

-> Data Consistency
-> Faster search
-> Ensure proper structure
-> Clean up data

1st Normal Form:

-> Only one of each in each column
-> Unique identification of rows


2nd Normal Form :

-> Remove redundancy of data in rows

3rd Normal Form :

-> Only columns with direct dependency of PK will be in entity.

From modelling to design :

-> Create Foreign keys
-> Enter datatypes
-> Resolve many to many relation to intermediate table.


Rule of Thumb:
Foreign key is on the many side and PK is on the one side.
