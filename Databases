1. SQL and NoSQL Databases :


2. B Trees for indexing in OLTP (Transaction)
3. Encoding of Data
4. Data Flow :
 
 Ways how data flows between processes:
• Via databases 
• Via service calls 
• Via asynchronous message passing 

a. Databases, where the process writing to the database encodes the data and the
process reading from the database decodes it

b. RPC and REST APIs, where the client encodes a request, the server decodes the
request and encodes a response, and the client finally decodes the response

c. Asynchronous message passing (using message brokers or actors), where nodes
communicate by sending each other messages that are encoded by the sender
and decoded by the recipient
