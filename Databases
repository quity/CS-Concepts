1. SQL and NoSQL Databases :


2. B Trees for indexing in OLTP (Transaction)
3. Encoding of Data
4. Data Flow :
 
 Ways how data flows between processes:
• Via databases 
• Via service calls 
• Via asynchronous message passing 

a. Databases, where the process writing to the database encodes the data and the
process reading from the database decodes it

b. RPC and REST APIs, where the client encodes a request, the server decodes the
request and encodes a response, and the client finally decodes the response

c. Asynchronous message passing (using message brokers or actors), where nodes
communicate by sending each other messages that are encoded by the sender
and decoded by the recipient

Using a message broker has several advantages compared to direct RPC:

• It can act as a buffer if the recipient is unavailable or overloaded, and thus
improve system reliability.
• It can automatically redeliver messages to a process that has crashed, and thus
prevent messages from being lost.
• It avoids the sender needing to know the IP address and port number of the
recipient (which is particularly useful in a cloud deployment where virtual
machines often come and go).
• It allows one message to be sent to several recipients.
• It logically decouples the sender from the recipient (the sender just publishes
messages and doesn’t care who consumes them).
