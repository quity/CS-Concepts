Virtualization makes it possible to create multiple virtual machines, each with their own operating system (OS) and applications, on a single physical machine. A VM cannot interact directly with a physical computer. Instead, it needs a lightweight software layer called a hypervisor to coordinate between it and the underlying physical hardware. 
The hypervisor allocates physical computing resources—such as processors, memory, and storage—to each VM. It keeps each VM separate from others so they don’t interfere with each other.
