Images and containers :

Fundamentally, a container is nothing but a running process, with some added encapsulation features applied to it in order to keep it 
isolated from the host and from other containers. 
One of the most important aspects of container isolation is that each container interacts with its own, private filesystem; this filesystem is provided by a Docker image. An image includes everything needed to run an 
application -- the code or binary, runtimes, dependencies, and any other filesystem objects required.
