CDN is short for content delivery network. A content delivery network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers (network) that deliver 
pages and other web content to a user, based on the geographic locations of the user, the origin of the webpage and the content delivery 
server.

This service is effective in speeding the delivery of content of websites with high traffic and websites that have global reach. 
The closer the CDN server is to the user geographically, the faster the content will be delivered to the user. 
CDNs also provide protection from large surges in traffic.
