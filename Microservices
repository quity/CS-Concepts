 The term Service refers to a software functionality or a set of software functionalities (such as the retrieval of specified information 
 or the execution of a set of operations) with a purpose that different clients can reuse for different purposes,together with the
 policies that should control its usage (based on the identity of the client requesting the service, for example).

Evolution :

monolithic ->  N-TIER  ->  SERVICE -> MICRO SERVICE -> SEERVERLESS

Advantages of Microservices :

1.	Independent Deployment
2.	Independent Development
3.	Fault Isolation
4.	Mixed Technology stack
5.	Granular Scaling (based on service requirements)

The drawbacks of microservices :

1.Developers must deal with the additional complexity of creating a distributed system.
2.Deployment complexity. In production, there is also the operational complexity of deploying and managing a system comprised of many 
different service types.
3.As you’re building a new microservice architecture, you’re likely to discover lots of cross-cutting concerns that you did not anticipate 
at design time.
