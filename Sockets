1. By default, TCP sockets are in "blocking" mode.

2. The "non-blocking" mode is set by changing one of the socket's "flags". The flags are a series of bits, each one representing a different capability of the socket. So, to turn on non-blocking mode requires three steps:

Call the fcntl() API to retrieve the socket descriptor's current flag settings into a local variable.

In our local variable, set the O_NONBLOCK (non-blocking) flag on. (being careful, of course, not to tamper with the other flags)

Call the fcntl() API to set the flags for the descriptor to the value in our local variable.
