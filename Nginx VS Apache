Apache:

Process Driven Approach 
Creates a new thread for each request.
Serves static content using the file-based method
Processes dynamic content within the server
Request Interpretation : Passes File system location
Supports customization of web server through dynamic modules.
Allows additional configuration on a per-directory basis via .htaccess files.
This architecture allows non-privileged users to control certain aspects of their website without granting them permission to edit the 
main config. This is big!

NGINX:

Event-Driven approach
Handles multiple requests within one thread
NGiNX – It has a lightweight structure, and much faster architecture than that of Apache.
It doesn’t process dynamic content.
Request Interpretation : Passes URI to interpret requests.
Not flexible enough to support dynamic modules and loading.
Doesn’t allow additional configuration
It, on the other hand, has a downside. It doesn’t provide additional configuration. However, it works in your favour as this increases the performance.
