SOCKET COMMUNICATION :

Socket programs are used to communicate between various processes usually running on different systems. 
It is mostly used to create a client-server environment.


PUB-SUB Model :

In software architecture, publishâ€“subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the 
messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without 
knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive 
messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.
