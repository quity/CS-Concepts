IPC :

SOCKET COMMUNICATION :

Socket programs are used to communicate between various processes usually running on different systems. 
It is mostly used to create a client-server environment.


PUB-SUB Model :

In software architecture, publish–subscribe is a messaging pattern where senders of messages, called publishers, do not program the 
messages to be sent directly to specific receivers, called subscribers, but instead categorize published messages into classes without 
knowledge of which subscribers, if any, there may be. Similarly, subscribers express interest in one or more classes and only receive 
messages that are of interest, without knowledge of which publishers, if any, there are.

MESSAGE QUEUES :

A message queue is a linked list of messages stored within the kernel and identified by a message queue identifier. A new queue is created or 
an existing queue opened by msgget().
New messages are added to the end of a queue by msgsnd(). Every message has a positive long integer type field, a non-negative length, and 
the actual data bytes (corresponding to the length), all of which are specified to msgsnd() when the message is added to a queue. 
Messages are fetched from a queue by msgrcv(). 
We don’t have to fetch the messages in a first-in, first-out order. Instead, we can fetch messages based on their type field.
